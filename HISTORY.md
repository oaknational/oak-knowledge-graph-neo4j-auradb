# Project Development History

## Project Overview
Oak Knowledge Graph Data Pipeline - Extract curriculum data from Hasura materialized views → transform to Neo4j CSV format → bulk import to Neo4j AuraDB.

## Specifications Created
- **FUNCTIONAL.md**: Complete functional requirements and acceptance criteria
- **ARCHITECTURE.md**: Technical architecture, design patterns, file structure
- **CLAUDE.md**: Compact development standards and quality gates
- **TO-DO.md**: 18 sequential tasks organized into 6 phases with dependencies

## Key Architectural Decisions
- **Language**: Python 3.8+ (leverages existing codebase)
- **Patterns**: Strategy + Factory for extensibility, Class-based pipeline
- **Dependencies**: pandas, requests, pydantic, streamlit, black, flake8, pytest
- **Structure**: pipeline/, models/, utils/, config/, tests/, data/ (gitignored)
- **UI**: Single-page Streamlit interface for local deployment only
- **Testing**: Unit tests only for MVP, pytest framework

## Completed Tasks

### ✅ Task 1: Environment Setup (Phase 1)
**Implementation Details:**
- Created root `requirements.txt` with locked dependencies from CLAUDE.md
- Built complete directory structure per ARCHITECTURE.md:
  ```
  pipeline/    # Core classes with __init__.py
  models/      # Pydantic schemas with __init__.py
  utils/       # Shared helpers with __init__.py
  config/      # JSON mappings
  data/        # Generated CSVs (gitignored)
  tests/       # Unit tests with __init__.py and fixtures/
  ```
- Enhanced `.gitignore` to explicitly ignore `data/` directory and `*.csv` files

**Quality Gates:** ✅ `pip install -r requirements.txt` works, structure matches ARCHITECTURE.md

### ✅ Task 2: Pydantic Data Models (Phase 1)
**Implementation Details:**
- Created `models/config.py`: FieldMapping, NodeMapping, RelationshipMapping, PipelineConfig
- Created `models/hasura.py`: HasuraResponse, MaterializedViewResponse for API validation
- Created `models/neo4j.py`: Neo4jNode/Relationship, ImportNode/Relationship, ImportCommand
- Added RelationshipMapping class (not in original ARCHITECTURE.md spec) with type, start/end node fields

**Quality Gates:** ✅ All models pass `black --check` and `flake8`, imports work correctly

### ✅ Task 3: Configuration Management (Phase 1)
**Implementation Details:**
- Created `pipeline/config_manager.py`: ConfigManager class with JSON loading/validation
- Created `config/schema_template.json`: Example configuration with curriculum nodes/relationships
- Created `.env.example`: Environment variable documentation for credentials
- Environment variable substitution: `${VAR_NAME}` placeholders in JSON automatically replaced
- Error handling: Clear validation messages with field paths and actionable descriptions

**Quality Gates:** ✅ Passes `black` and `flake8`, loads/validates configs correctly

### ✅ Task 4: Base Strategy Classes (Phase 2)
**Implementation Details:**
- Created `pipeline/extractors.py`: ExtractionStrategy abstract base class + ExtractorFactory
- Created `pipeline/transformers.py`: TransformationStrategy and RelationshipTransformationStrategy abstract classes + TransformerFactory
- Factory pattern implementation with strategy registration, creation, and discovery methods
- Added RelationshipTransformationStrategy (enhancement) to handle relationship mappings separately from nodes

**Quality Gates:** ✅ Passes `black --check` and `flake8`, all imports successful

**Key Features:**
- Strategy pattern with proper ABC abstractmethod enforcement
- Factory pattern supports dynamic strategy selection based on configuration
- Clear error messages for unknown strategy names
- Interface contracts match ARCHITECTURE.md specification

## Current State
**Next Task:** Task 5 - Hasura Extractor (continuing Phase 2)

## Established Patterns
- **File Organization**: Strict adherence to ARCHITECTURE.md structure
- **Quality Standards**: Black formatting + flake8 linting enforced, systematic line length fixes
- **Strategy Pattern**: Abstract base classes with factory registration for extensible components
- **Pydantic Models**: Comprehensive validation for all data flows (config, API, Neo4j)
- **Error Handling**: Fail-fast with clear, actionable error messages
- **Configuration**: Environment variable substitution with `${VAR_NAME}` syntax

## Architecture Enhancements
- **RelationshipTransformationStrategy**: Added separate strategy for relationship transformations to properly handle the distinction between node and relationship mappings in our config model

## Critical Path Progress
Tasks 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5 → 7 → 8 → 9 → 10 → 13 → 15 → 18
**Status: 4/18 complete (22.2%)**
